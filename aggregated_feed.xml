      <description>Azure Integrated HSM marks a major shift in how cryptographic keys are handled&#8212;moving from centralized clusters&#8230; to local, tamper&#8209;resistant modules embedded directly in virtual machines. This new model brings cryptographic assurance closer to the workload, reducing latency, increasing throughput, and redefining what&#8217;s possible for secure applications in the cloud.
Before diving into this innovation, let&#8217;s take a step back. Microsoft&#8217;s journey with HSMs in Azure spans nearly a decade, evolving through multiple architectures, vendors, and compliance models. From shared services to dedicated clus...</description>

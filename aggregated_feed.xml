      <description>Last month, when I blogged about riding the AI wave, I reviewed the reality of AI Agent adoption, basic information about agents, and the challenge of managing them at scale. I could only hint about what we&#8217;d announce at Microsoft Ignite: a huge update for the Microsoft Entra Agent ID public preview.
I&#8217;d like to thank customers and partners who&#8217;ve been paddling out to the deep waters of agent visibility and security with us. Your feedback has been crucial in this journey, and it was super cool to feature a few of you in my Agent ID Ignite session. Thank you.

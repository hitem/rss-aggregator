      <description>Why TLS 1.3 matters&#160;
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the protocol that encrypts traffic between clients and servers.
For many years, most SQL Server environments have relied on TLS 1.2, which dates back to 2008.
TLS 1.3, finalized in 2018, is a significant evolution. It brings three main benefits:&#160;
Better performance&#160;
With fewer roundtrips and faster negotiation, secure connections are&#160;established&#160;much more quickly in practice&#160;
Stronger security&#160;

Old and weak algorithms are removed (RC4, SHA1, MD5, DES, 3DES&#8230;)
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is mandatory. Even if a private key is compromised ...</description>

      <description>Overview
This notebook, titled &#8220;Guided Hunting - Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection&#8221;, provides a framework for investigating anomalous network activity by identifying domains generated by algorithms, which are often used by malware to evade detection. It integrates data from Log Analytics (DeviceNetworkEvents) and employs Python-based tools and libraries such as &#8220;msticpy&#8221;, &#8220;pandas&#8221;, and &#8220;scikit-learn&#8221; for analysis and visualization. DGA detection is crucial for cybersecurity as it helps identify and mitigate threats like botnets and malware that use dynamically generated domains for c...</description>

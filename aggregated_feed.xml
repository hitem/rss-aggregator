      <description>Introduction
One of the key challenges in managing cloud infrastructure with Azure DevOps is maintaining clear traceability between pipeline executions and modifications to Azure resources. Unlike some integrated CI/CD platforms, Azure does not natively link resource changes to specific DevOps pipelines, making it difficult to track which deployment introduced a particular modification.
To address this gap, two approaches have been presented that improve traceability and accountability:

Proactive tagging of resources with pipeline metadata during deployment.
Analyzing Azure Activity Logs to t...</description>

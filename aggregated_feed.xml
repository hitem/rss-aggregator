      <description>Introduction
Maintaining the health of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) sensors is essential for ensuring continuous security visibility across your virtual machine (VM) infrastructure. When a sensor transitions from an "Active" to an "Inactive" state, it indicates a loss of telemetry from that device and potentially creating blind spots in your security posture. To proactively address this risk, it's important to detect these transitions promptly and alert your security team for timely remediation.
This guide walks you through a practical approach to automate this process using a Kusto Q...</description>

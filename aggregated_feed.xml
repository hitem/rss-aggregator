      <description>Going to RSA? We&#8217;re recording short, 15-minute Microsoft Security podcast conversations live at the conference- focused on real-world practitioner experience. No pitches, no slides, no marketing. Just an honest conversation about what you&#8217;re seeing, what&#8217;s changed, and what you&#8217;d tell a peer. If you&#8217;re doing the work and want to share your perspective, we&#8217;d love to hear from you.

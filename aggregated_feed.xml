1. Introduction
In modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs), mapping detections to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is critical. MITRE ATT&amp;CK provides a structured, globally recognized model of adversary behavior, categorized into Tactics (goals) and Techniques (methods).
Microsoft Sentinel analytic rules frequently include MITRE mappings, but viewing or exporting these at scale isn&#8217;t straightforward within the portal.
Security teams often need:
&#8226; A centralized view of existing detections mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK
&#8226; A CSV export for reporting, audits, and threat coverage assessments

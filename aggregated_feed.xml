      <description>Most DIY security data lakes start with good intentions&#8212;promising flexibility, control, and cost savings. But in reality, they lead to endless data ingestion fixes, schema drift battles, and soaring costs. They fail because they lack the capabilities to manage security data that&#8217;s not just massive, but complex, dynamic, and compliance heavy.

Ingestion chaos: Every team implements its own pipelines for diverse data sets like firewalls, endpoint, network, threat intelligence feeds, and more.

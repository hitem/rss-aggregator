      <description>In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk through an end-to-end example showing how to:

Install the NGINX Ingress Controller as a DaemonSet
Configure it to automatically inject a Content Security Policy (CSP) header
Deploy a simple &#8220;Hello World&#8221; NGINX app (myapp)
Tie everything together with an Ingress resource that routes traffic and verifies CSP

By the end, you&#8217;ll have a pattern where:

Every request to your application carries a strong CSP header
Your application code remains unchanged (CSP is injected at the gateway layer)
You can test both inside the cluster and externally to confirm CSP is enforced
